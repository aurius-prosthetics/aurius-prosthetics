## About Aurius

Hi, I'm King Oung, founder of Aurius Prosthetics. We're revolutionizing accessibility in prosthetic ear design through cutting-edge 3D printing technology. Our mission is to provide **affordable, accessible, and aesthetically realistic** prosthetic solutions for individuals with microtia, empowering them with greater confidence and self-expression.

By leveraging innovative materials and user-centered design, we bridge the gap between medical necessity and personal identity, ensuring everyone has access to high-quality, customizable prosthetics.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Customizable Design** - Personalized ear shapes and sizes
- **💰 Cost-Effective** - Open-source designs reduce costs dramatically
- **📐 Precision Crafted** - Generated using LiDAR technology for accurate proportions
- **🧲 Multiple Attachment Options** - Magnetic, clip-on, or suction mounting
- **🤝 Community-Driven** - Open-source CAD files for collaboration
- **🪶 Lightweight & Realistic** - Skin-like texture using flexible materials

## 🚀 Quick Start

### What You'll Need
- 3D printer compatible with flexible filaments
- **Recommended Filament:** Filaflex 82A or similar TPE/TPU
- Basic assembly tools

### Printing Process
1. **Download** your desired `.3MF` file from the [models folder](./models)
2. **Print** using TPE/TPU filament for flexibility (PLA works for prototypes)
3. **Assemble** following our detailed guide
4. **Customize** using provided CAD files as needed

*Compatible with Bambu Labs printers - adjust settings accordingly*
