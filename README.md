Aurius Prosthetics - Open-source initiative for 3D-printed prosthetic ears.

Hi, my name is King Oung, and I am the founder of Aurius Prosthetics, an open-source assistive technology initiative. At Aurius, we are focused on revolutionizing accessibility and personalization in prosthetic ear design through cutting-edge 3D printing technology. The goal of this initiative is to provide affordable, accessible, and aesthetically realistic solutions for individuals with microtia, empowering them with greater confidence and self-expression. By leveraging innovative materials and user-centered design, we aim to bridge the gap between medical necessity and unique personal identity, ensuring that every individual has access to high-quality, customizable prosthetics that seamlessly integrate into their lives. **You can check out our website at [aurius.tw] to learn more about our initiative**

## Features üíô
- Customizable ear designs using flexible TPE/TPU materials
- Accessible and cost-effective open-sourced designs, easily 3D printed
- Generated using LiDAR technology, ensuring accurate and proportional prosthetic solutions
- Magnet/clip-on attachment options
- Open-source CAD files for community collaboration  
- Lightweight and skin-like texture

## Usage ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Download desired .3MF files for direct printing (Each model is different in shape/size)
- Print the prosthetic ear using a 3D printer with TPE/TPU filament for flexibility (PLA also works as just a model/replica)  
- Follow the assembly guide to attach the ear using the chosen method (magnetic, clip-on, suction).  
- Customize and alter the design as needed with CAD files provided in the `models` folder.

## Materials and Design üí°
- Recommended filament: Filaflex 82A or similar TPE/TPU 
- Compatible with Bambu Labs Printers, adjust printer settings accordingly when using the print files
- CAD files available in STL and 3MF formats

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
- [x] Initial prototype development (LiDAR, designing/modelling, developing a working formula)
- [x] Testing and refinement of attachment methods, different materials, shapes, and sizes
- [ ] Community feedback and design improvements  
- [ ] Collaboration with medical professionals for ergonomic adjustments and potential industry contributions
