# Disclaimers Before Printing
Here are a few issues and tips that I found while experimenting, which will help you reduce errors and get better quality print results

## Printing with TPU
Printing with PLA works well, it is consistent, strong, and cheap/accessible. However, it is hard and doesnâ€™t mimic a real ear 
Printing with TPU, such as Filaflex 82a can mimic the softness of a real ear, but it is EXTEREMELY DIFFICULT to get right, here are some things I encountered on my first print:
Settings for printing TPU: TPU needs to be tuned with a lot of different settings: print speed, nozzle and bed heating, speed, fan cooling settings, length, retraction, flow, layer height, etc.
TPU also needs to be especially calibrated/fitted for your printer, for the Bambu Labs A1, you cannot use AMS and you have to manually input the external filament as TPU in settings so that your printer know it is TPU.

Below are some problems I encountered on my first print:
Bed Adhesion: TPU sticks to the bed, it is hard to scrape off the print without damaging the bottom layer
Stringing/inconsistent flow, the flow of the filament can become inconsistent due to the softness of the filament, it can get clogged etc, You cannot print on fast speeds, around 30 mms for all parts is a good.
Nozzle width, TPU seems so shrink when printing, there are a lot of small holes that appear when you print, which has to do with flow, nozzle sizes, and MOST IMPORTANTLY: Print Speed.
TPU will take much longer to print if you want a high quality print compared to PLA, you have to print extremely slow, around 10mm/s-30mm/s
If you live in a humid environment, or even if there is just some moisture in the air, leaving your TPU out could reduce print quality as the filament performs poorly when absorbing moisture.

During the second/third print, I lowered speeds even more, roughly 20 mm/s for all sections, which improved print quality dramatically
I also lowered nozzle temperature to 220 degrees celsius, which also helped make the print smoother.
I increased the flow ratio of the filament to 1.2 so that more filament is extruded in order to try and fill in the small gaps and holes that are created on the first print. (TPU Tends to shrink under heat, so a high flow ratio may be helpful.
I also increased the line width of the overall project to 0.45mm, while increasing the top and bottom layers to 0.5mm for a fuller finish
Lastly, I waited for the print plate to cool down, to room temperature, before using a thin razor and carefully detaching the print from the plate.
I highly recommend you to tweak around with the settings a little bit. Be sure to watch the first layer of the print to make sure everything works well, and that the print quality is good.
